#### DLVK is a mod with optimizes Dying Light for the [DXVK](https://www.github.com/doitsujin/dxvk) translation layer.
_You may find several benefits including increased framerate stability, framerate levels, reduced input delay, and enhanced visuals.
This project is originally intended for [Valve's Proton](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/)/SteamPlay. However, it does work exceptionally on Windows 10.
DLVK has not been tested on Windows 8.1, Windows 8, or Windows 7._

**_No I am not responsible for maintaining its functionality on Windows platforms as this was created on Linux for Proton/Linux. Though I will make using it on Windows as easy as I can :)_**
