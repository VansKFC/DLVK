# Dying Light Vulkan

### DLVK is a simple:
 - performance 
 - cosmetic
 - efficiency
##### touchup of the game [Dying Light](https://dyinglightgame.com/dyinglight/) originally using the [Direct3D11](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3d11/atoc-dx-graphics-direct3d-11) and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) rendering API's and shading languages using [DXVK](https://github.com/doitsujin/dxvk)

#

### DLVK is not:
- a vector for cheats
- a cheat in general

_This provides no intentional unfair advantage over other players in any way._

#

**I am fairly new to GitHub as well so expect mishaps.** _sorry :(_
